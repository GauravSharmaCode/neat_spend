# 🚀 NeatSpend Microservices - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ **No Separate Repo Needed!** 

Your current **monorepo structure** is production-ready and follows industry best practices. You can scale to handle millions of users with this setup.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
📦 neat_spend/ (One Repository)
├── 🔧 services/                    # All microservices
│   ├── 👤 user-service/            # User management (Port 3001)
│   ├── 🌐 neatspend-api/          # API Gateway (Port 8080)
│   ├── 💡 ai-insight-service/     # AI insights
│   └── 📱 sms-sync-worker/        # SMS processing
├── 🔗 shared/                     # Shared utilities
├── 🐳 docker-compose.yml          # Service orchestration
└── ⚙️ .github/workflows/          # CI/CD pipelines
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Your Current Setup

- ✅ **Independent Deployment**: Each service has its own Docker container
- ✅ **Independent Databases**: Each service manages its own data
- ✅ **Scalable**: Can handle individual service scaling
- ✅ **Production-Grade**: HTTP proxying, health checks, logging
- ✅ **Developer Friendly**: Single `git clone` gets everything

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Start All Services
```bash
# Start with Docker (Recommended)
npm run docker:up

# Or start individually for development
npm run dev:all
```

### 2. Test Your Architecture
```bash
# Test service communication
npm run test:services
```

### 3. Access Your Services
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080
- **User Service**: http://localhost:3001
- **Database**: localhost:5432

## 🔄 Service Communication

Your API Gateway automatically routes requests:

```bash
# These requests go through API Gateway → User Service
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login

# Direct access to User Service (for development)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Health Checks

```bash
# Check overall system health
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check individual service health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Services
```bash
# Generate new service boilerplate
npm run create-service transaction-service
```

### Working with Databases
```bash
# Migrate user service database
npm run db:migrate:user-service

# Migrate API database
npm run db:migrate:api
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test all services
npm run test:all

# Test specific service
npm run test:user-service
```

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

### Development (Docker)
- Postgres: Auto-configured in docker-compose.yml
- Services: Auto-discovery via Docker networking

### Production
- Set `USER_SERVICE_URL` environment variable
- Configure database URLs per service
- Set up load balancer in front of API Gateway

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

### Current Capabilities
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more containers per service
- **Independent Deployment**: Deploy services separately
- **Load Balancing**: Put load balancer in front of API Gateway

### Future Growth Options
- **Database Sharding**: Per service or per tenant
- **Message Queues**: Add async communication
- **Service Mesh**: Add Istio/Linkerd for advanced networking
- **Multi-Repo**: Extract services when teams grow (optional)

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Helmet.js security headers
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Request/response logging
- ✅ Input validation middleware
- ✅ JWT authentication ready
- ✅ Database query logging

## 📋 Service Health Matrix

| Service | Port | Health Endpoint | Database | Status |
|---------|------|----------------|----------|---------|
| API Gateway | 8080 | `/health` | None (Proxy) | ✅ Ready |
| User Service | 3001 | `/health` | `neatspend_users` | ✅ Ready |
| AI Insights | 8082 | `/health` | `neatspend_insights` | 🚧 Planned |
| SMS Worker | 8081 | `/health` | `neatspend_sms` | 🚧 Planned |

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **✅ Complete** - Your microservice architecture is ready!
2. **Implement Features** - Add business logic to services
3. **Add Services** - Use `npm run create-service` for new domains
4. **Production Deploy** - Use your CI/CD pipeline
5. **Monitor** - Set up observability (metrics, traces, logs)

## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Should I create separate repositories?
**A: No!** Your monorepo is perfect for:
- Teams < 50 developers
- Services that evolve together  
- Shared dependencies and tooling
- Simplified CI/CD

### Q: How do I deploy individual services?
**A:** Your CI/CD pipeline detects changes per service:
```yaml
# Automatically deploys only changed services
on:
  push:
    paths: ['services/user-service/**']
```

### Q: Can this scale to production?
**A: Absolutely!** Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Uber use monorepos for microservices.

### Q: How do I add authentication?
**A:** Your user service already has JWT middleware ready. Enable it in your routes.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Services won't start
```bash
# Check Docker logs
docker-compose logs user-service

# Check if ports are available
netstat -tulpn | grep :3001
```

### Database connection issues
```bash
# Reset databases
npm run docker:down
npm run docker:up
```

### API Gateway proxy errors
```bash
# Check service connectivity
npm run test:services
```

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You have a **production-grade microservice architecture** that can scale with your business. No need for separate repositories - your monorepo gives you the best of both worlds: microservice benefits with monorepo simplicity.
