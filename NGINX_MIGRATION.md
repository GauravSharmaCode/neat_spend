# Migration from Express.js to Nginx API Gateway

This document outlines the migration from the Express.js API Gateway (`neatspend-api`) to the new Nginx-based API Gateway (`nginx-gateway`).

## Why Nginx?

- **Performance**: Nginx handles concurrent connections more efficiently
- **Resource Usage**: Lower memory footprint and CPU usage
- **Built-in Features**: Rate limiting, load balancing, and caching out of the box
- **Stability**: Battle-tested in production environments
- **Simplicity**: Less code to maintain, configuration-based routing

## Changes Made

### 1. New Service Structure
```
services/
├── nginx-gateway/          # New Nginx-based gateway
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── nginx.conf
│   ├── README.md
│   └── test-gateway.sh
└── neatspend-api/          # Legacy Express.js gateway (deprecated)
```

### 2. Docker Compose Updates
- Replaced `neatspend-api` service with `nginx-gateway`
- Added health check on port 8090
- Removed Node.js dependencies for the gateway

### 3. Endpoint Compatibility
All existing endpoints remain the same:
- `GET /` - Gateway information
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication routes (proxied to user-service)
- `GET /api/v1/users/*` - User routes (proxied to user-service)
- `GET /users` - Legacy deprecation notice

### 4. New Features
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second for API, 5 requests/second for auth
- **Enhanced Logging**: Request timing and upstream response times
- **Security Headers**: XSS protection, content type validation
- **Internal Health Check**: Separate endpoint on port 8090

## Migration Steps

### 1. Stop Current Services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 2. Build New Gateway
```bash
docker-compose build nginx-gateway
```

### 3. Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Test the Gateway
```bash
cd services/nginx-gateway
chmod +x test-gateway.sh
./test-gateway.sh
```

## Verification

### Check Gateway Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8090/nginx-health
```

### Test User Service Proxy
```bash
# Should proxy to user-service
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users
```

### Verify Rate Limiting
```bash
# Send multiple requests quickly to test rate limiting
for i in {1..15}; do curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users; done
```

## Performance Benefits

### Before (Express.js)
- Node.js runtime overhead
- JavaScript event loop limitations
- Memory usage: ~50-100MB
- Custom proxy middleware

### After (Nginx)
- Native C implementation
- Efficient connection handling
- Memory usage: ~10-20MB
- Built-in proxy capabilities

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can quickly rollback:

1. **Update docker-compose.yml**:
```yaml
# Comment out nginx-gateway service
# nginx-gateway:
#   build: ./services/nginx-gateway

# Uncomment neatspend-api service
neatspend-api:
  build: ./services/neatspend-api
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  # ... rest of configuration
```

2. **Restart services**:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

## Future Enhancements

The Nginx gateway is ready for:
- **SSL/TLS termination**
- **Caching layer** (Redis integration)
- **Advanced load balancing** (multiple service instances)
- **Request/response transformation**
- **API versioning** (header-based routing)

## Monitoring

### Log Files
- Access logs: `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
- Error logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`

### Health Checks
- Gateway health: `http://localhost:8080/health`
- Internal health: `http://localhost:8090/nginx-health`
- Service connectivity: Automatically checked via upstream health

### Metrics
The Nginx configuration includes timing information:
- Request time
- Upstream connect time
- Upstream header time
- Upstream response time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Service Not Found**
   - Check upstream service is running
   - Verify service names in docker-compose.yml

2. **Rate Limiting Errors**
   - Adjust rate limits in nginx.conf
   - Check if legitimate traffic is being blocked

3. **CORS Issues**
   - Verify CORS headers in nginx.conf
   - Check origin configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check nginx configuration
docker exec nginx-gateway nginx -t

# View nginx logs
docker logs nginx-gateway

# Check upstream services
docker exec nginx-gateway curl http://user-service:3001/health
```
